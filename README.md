Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 9 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
In this project, we build a model using Auto AI and Node-red  web application where we can showcase the prediction of heart failure.
